# Inventory Manager MP3
## Introduction:
The project ‘**Inventory Manager**’ is based on stock control within a research and development company. There are two different types of stock which are generally held, these are solvents (ethanol, methanol, dimethylsulfoxide etc) and consumables (pipettes, plates, tips, labels etc). All these items must be tracked to make sure the storeroom / warehouse does not run out and can reorder in time. The application will hold information around products which are held on stock, minimum quantities required before ordering and the ability to add, update and delete products when are no longer required.

## UX:
### User Goals
* Build an app that allows the user to search for products held within a stock room.
* User should be able to update the quantity remaining.
* User can request for new products to be added through a request form.
* Administrator can create, update, delete and search for products.
* Administrator level is password protected.
* Interface is easy to use and navigate through.

## User ideas:
* “Update function should be available”

## Requirements:
The requirements for the application are as follows:
* User can see what is available in both categories.
* Quantities can be updated when products are removed.
* Navigation bar will collapse on mobile devices.
* Products can be edited.
* New products can be added.
* Products which are no longer required can be removed from the database.
* New products can be requested.
* Navigation between pages.

## Design:
The design for this application is based around multiple pages. Some of these pages are available via the navigation bar whilst others will appear depending on the function requested. The pages available via the navigation bar will be home, solvents, consumables, requests and admin page. The solvent and consumable pages will be similar in style but will have different fields.
## Images:
Icons have be taken from the [font awesome website]( https://fontawesome.com/) and the main image is from [](). The main image used is glass beakers filled with coloured liquids and I believe this represents well a laboratory environment.
## Fonts:
## Colours:
The colours which I have used are in keeping with the main image  of the coloured beakers.
They are:
* rgb(83, 226, 226) - an aqua colour.
